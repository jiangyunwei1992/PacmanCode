This repository includes the algorithms of pacman move control. In the UninformedAlgorithms class, BFS and DFS are implemented and in the InformedAlgorithms clss, only A* algorithm is implemented with the built-in methods.

DFS: time complexity: O(n+e) space complexity:O(|n|)

BFS: time complexity：O(n+e) space complexity：O(|n|+|e|)

A*: time complexity: O(log(heapSize)) space complexity:O(|n|+|e|)
