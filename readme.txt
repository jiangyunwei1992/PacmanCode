This repository includes the algorithms of pacman move control. In the UninformedAlgorithms class, BFS and DFS are implemented and in the InformedAlgorithms clss, only A* algorithm is implemented with the built-in methods.

DFS: time complexity: O(b^m) space complexity:O(b^m)

BFS: time complexity：O(b^m) space complexity：O(mb)

A*: time complexity: O(log(heapSize)) space complexity:O(|n|+|e|)


////////////
For HW3: before running the code, make sure that the environment is full observable. And for HW2, make sure the environment is partially observable.
